MongoDB Log Analyzer - Project Overview
==========================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT
------------------

Database administrators and developers working with MongoDB face significant challenges when analyzing database performance:

1. **Manual Log Analysis Overhead**
   - MongoDB generates extensive log files containing critical performance data
   - Manual parsing of large log files (100MB+) is time-consuming and error-prone
   - Identifying performance bottlenecks requires hours of manual log review
   - No centralized tool for systematic analysis of MongoDB operational data

2. **Lack of Performance Visibility**
   - Slow queries are buried in massive log files with millions of entries
   - Difficult to identify patterns and trends in query performance over time
   - No easy way to correlate slow queries with specific database operations
   - Limited visibility into connection patterns, authentication events, and resource usage

3. **Inefficient Troubleshooting Process**
   - When performance issues occur, teams spend excessive time searching through logs
   - No systematic approach to identify root causes of database slowdowns
   - Difficult to generate actionable recommendations for database optimization
   - Lack of historical data analysis for capacity planning and trend identification

4. **Data Analysis Complexity**
   - MongoDB log format requires specialized parsing knowledge
   - Complex queries needed to extract meaningful insights from raw log data
   - No standardized approach for performance metric calculation and reporting
   - Limited export capabilities for further analysis in external tools
