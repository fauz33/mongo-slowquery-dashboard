MongoDB Log Analyzer - Project Summary
=========================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The MongoDB Log Analyzer is a comprehensive web-based application designed to parse, analyze, and visualize MongoDB log files to identify performance bottlenecks, slow queries, and database optimization opportunities. The application provides an intuitive dashboard and analytical tools to help database administrators and developers understand MongoDB performance patterns.

PURPOSE & PROBLEM STATEMENT
---------------------------
MongoDB generates extensive log files containing valuable performance data, but analyzing these logs manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Database administrators often struggle to:

1. Identify slow-performing queries quickly
2. Understand query patterns and trends over time
3. Correlate database performance with specific operations
4. Generate actionable insights for database optimization
5. Monitor connection patterns and authentication events
6. Track resource utilization and performance metrics

The traditional approach of manually parsing log files or using basic text search tools is inefficient for large-scale MongoDB deployments where log files can be hundreds of megabytes in size.

OBJECTIVE
---------
To create an automated, intelligent log analysis system that:
- Efficiently parses large MongoDB log files (up to 100MB+)
- Extracts and categorizes different types of database events
- Provides visual analytics and trend analysis
- Offers actionable recommendations for performance optimization
- Enables quick identification of problematic queries and patterns
- Supports data export for further analysis

3. WEB-BASED DASHBOARD
   - Interactive dashboard with key performance indicators
   - Real-time statistics and summary metrics
   - Visual charts and graphs for trend analysis
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile access

4. SEARCH & FILTERING
   - Advanced search functionality across all log events
   - Keyword-based search with relevance scoring
   - Field-specific filtering (database, collection, operation type)
   - Pagination for handling large result sets

5. ANALYTICAL TOOLS
   - Index recommendation engine
   - Query trend analysis over time
   - Workload pattern identification
   - Performance bottleneck detection
   - Operation type classification and analysis

6. DATA EXPORT & REPORTING
